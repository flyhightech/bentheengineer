The main text on the page reads HI, I'M BERNARD in large blue letters, followed by the bolded word FATHE and a blinking cursor. Below, a paragraph introduces Bernard as the founder and CTO of Flyhightech LLC, a self-taught software developer from Chicago with a passion for user-friendly designs and easy-to-use interfaces for websites and mobile apps. The background is light with a soft, professional tone, and the navigation menu in the top right corner includes links for Home, About, and Portfolio.]
